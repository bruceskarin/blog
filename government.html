<h1>Government</h1>
<p>The complaints about government from supporters range far and wide. Some of the complaints relate more closely to other issues, but the focus for ranking this particular priority was on national debt, spending, and taxes. To have a sustainable government, we must find a way to balance spending with the strength of our economy. Debates over taxes versus spending cuts are trivial so long as the growth in spending exceeds the growth of our economy.</p>

<p>Without fixing this imbalance, the threat of national debt overwhelming future generations is very real. The solution is not as simple as raising taxes and/or cutting spending, because they are both deeply related to our economy. Fixing this particular system requires a careful analysis of tax policy and of the economic returns on different types of spending. Our guiding principle in the analysis of taxes will be to reduce or eliminate taxes on activities that create and renew, while levying or raising taxes on activities that pollute and destroy. On spending, the analysis will focus on maximizing the return on your tax dollars, both in terms of economic and societal gains.</p>

<p>Our current tax code has been used primarily as a political device to win support from the funders of campaigns and to curry favor with voters. As a result the net tax rate for individuals is widely distorted, allowing campaign funders to enjoy far lower tax rates than the average taxpayer.</p>

<p>Countless studies have shown that both individuals and our economy would see significant gains from a reformed and simplified tax code. Achieving real reform will require an independent perspective that clearly communicates how the new code will work and how it will improve your bottom line.</p>

<p>As Senator I will use my experience in computer modeling to expose the issues with our current tax code while providing clear and easy to understand explanations of how the net individual tax rates will drop for the vast majority of Americans while freeing markets from the crony capitalism that is holding our economy back. The combination of these changes will not only improve individual wealth and strengthen our economy, but will also ensure that national debt is eliminated before the next economic disruption.</p>

<p>At the same time I will create an open and transparent system for identifying the largest areas of waste in spending as well as the programs that are providing the greatest return on tax dollars both in the near and the long term. By taking a modern approach we will be able to upgrade the operating system of government so that is efficient and responsive to the needs of individuals and businesses.</p>

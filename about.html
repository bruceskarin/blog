<h1>Meet Bruce</h1>
<p>I want to represent Massachusetts in the US Senate for three main reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>As a <strong><a href="/father">Father</a></strong>, I want Congress to do a better job managing the future for our children and generations to come</li>
<li>As a <strong><a href="/scientist" >Scientist</a></strong> I know from experience that we can and must meet these challenges using a modern approach to government</li>
<li>And as an <strong><a href="/independent">Independent</a></strong>, because the system we have now will remain broken until we bring representation back to the people</li>
</ol>

<p>I do not believe that I can win just because I am a political outsider with some good ideas, but rather because I believe that when we fix our political system first, <strong>we the people</strong> can win.</p>

<p>I am here to provide strong, smart leadership, while also taking the time to really listen to voters.

<h1>The Economy</h1>
<p>It is time to stop holding our economy back and put Americans to work again. To have a strong economy we must first free it from the crony capitalism that has distorted our markets, allowed institutions to hand off risk to taxpayers, and let industries pass on the cost of their actions to everyone.</p>

<p>As Senator I will work to expose and eliminate the system of corruption in Washington so that we can begin honest reforms that ready our country for the economy of the future. I will also develop a national strategy for repairing our markets and for aligning our research, education, and infrastructure with the demands of our time </p>

<p>I firmly believe that we are approaching a period with the potential for massive economic growth as we make the transition towards greater automation and efficiency in manufacturing and a return to local, customized products and services.</p>

<p>After decades of energy price increases, I also believe that by correcting market imbalances we will see a sharp decline in energy costs as we move away from finite resources that are only getting more costly and risky to extract, towards renewable sources that are only getting cheaper and more efficient.</p>

<p>Making this transition requires bold new ideas from leaders that have a deep understanding of science and engineering. We need to be ambitious with changes to our infrastructure, using automation to eliminate traffic, improve safety, and revolutionize transport. The economy of the future will also require networks that are robust and able to handle the increasing volume of our digital lives while maintaining the standards of openness that have spurred innovation and development.</p>

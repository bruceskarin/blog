title: Bruce Skarin - The Environment

<h1>The Environment</h1>
<p>As stewards of our planet we must have an environment that does not get pushed to the brink of collapse by an energy policy that is vulnerable to conflict, dependent upon a finite resource, and that will only get more costly and risky to extract.</p>

<p>We can ensure a more sustainable future by taking risk seriously, by correcting the distortions in our market that do not properly account for the costs of polluting our commons, and by transitioning to renewable sources that will only get cheaper and more efficient.</p>

<p>As a scientist I have a more clear understanding than most regarding the complexities associated with climate change. The fundamental issue, however, is simple. <strong>As long as we produce more CO2 than the earth can absorb, the total amount of CO2 will continue to grow.</strong></p>

<p>Debates over how much is too much are really only a distraction from the simple reality that runaway CO2 levels equals runaway risks, with costs that are likely to overwhelm future generations. Don't just take my word for it though, look at and interact with the <a href="http://climate.nasa.gov/key_indicators#co2" target="_blank">Key Indicators</a> for yourself.</p>

<p>We can avoid that future by enacting smart pragmatic policies that reduce the risk while providing huge benefits to us all. The price of oil will only go up in the long term while the price of renewables will only go down. A <a href="http://news.stanford.edu/news/2014/february/fifty-states-renewables-022414.html">study by Stanford</a> has already shown that we can make this transition with smart investments starting right now.</p>

<p>As Senator, I will help lead the way on this issue, making sure that we have truly independent and comprehensive solutions that strengthen our economy and protect our planet for generations to come.</p>

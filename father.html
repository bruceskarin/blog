title: Bruce Skarin - Father

<h1>Father</h1>
<p>My family is the first reason for why I am running. I am fortunate to be married to an amazing woman and father of two wonderful boys. I am willing to make the personal sacrifice required for such a position because I want a future with increasing opportunities and fewer problems for my children and the generations to come. That future is danger.</p>

<p>The cost of a college education has soared over <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-08-26/college-costs-surge-500-in-u-s-since-1985-chart-of-the-day.html" target="_blank">500% since 1985</a>, far out-pacing the growth of everything else, including healthcare. There is also an increasing risk of catastrophic consequences for problems like long-term climate change, national debt, and many others that took decades to create and will now take decades to fix. Put plainly, when I look to the future I see a world filled with problems that my generation should be working on right now.</p>

<p>As a <a href="/scientist">scientist</a> I know that these problems can indeed be solved when we use the right approach, when we represent the people first, and most importantly when we stop waiting to address them. The kind of deep social change needed begins with family, builds into a community, a country, and carries all the way through to how our society works as a whole to create liberty and justice for all.</p>

<p>Our Congress has been corrupted by a broken system. The political and social ideals we used to ascribe to have been pushed out of the way by the powerful interests of individuals. This is not how a Republic, a representative democracy, is designed to operate. Our country is in trouble and it needs an intervention.</p>

<p>I see my country as my family and when my family is in trouble I help out, and that is why it is my first reason for running.</p>

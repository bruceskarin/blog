<h1>Research</h1>

<p>At the <a href="http://ethics.harvard.edu/hacking-icorruption#about" target="_blank">Hacking iCorruption</a> event, 
my team placed third with <a href="http://dmil.github.io/iCorruptionHack/" target="_blank">campaignCON</a> that includes 
technology for monitoring changes in reports to the Federal Election Commission and for visualizing the changes that took 
place in the networks of large dollar campaign financing over the last 24 years.</p>

<p>At the 2015 International Conference of the System Dynamics Society I presented work done with a colleague titled: 
<a href="assets/US_Campaign_Finance_and_Institutional_Corruption_in_Public_Policy.pdf" target="_blank">U.S. Campaign Finance 
and Institutional Corruption in Public Policy</a>, which represents five years of research and personal experience in dealing with 
this issue. In this paper we use Lawrence Lessig's definition of institutional corruption to map the relationships between the funding 
of campaigns, influence over policy, income disparity, and voter satisfaction, engagement, and participation to provide the most 
comprehensive description to date of this challenging problem.</p>

<p>As a result of our analysis we provide both a stark warning and a way forward for restoring citizen equality and representative 
democracy in America. In the coming months we will be exploring avenues for publishing and presenting this work. 
Your feedback and suggestions are welcome.</p>

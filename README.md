##Bruce Skarin
###Father, Scientist, & Activist

I am a scientist and writer obsessed with understanding big problems that require well designed solutions. By education and by trade I am a modeler, which means I build computer models that describe the structure of problems so they can be simulated and compared to historic real-world behavior in order to develop long lasting, efficient solutions. Put more simply, I use computers to help solve problems that _cannot_ be solved without their aid.

After the birth of my first of two sons in 2010, my research into our inability to act on large-scale issues such as climate change and national debt led me to Congress, which then led me to money in politics. Since then, I have dedicated a great deal of time, energy, and treasure to understanding and addressing the causes and consequences of the institutionalized form of corruption that has hijacked our country. A corruption that is the singular root cause preventing our country from dealing with every other pressing issue before us.

In my efforts to raise awareness and promote understanding, I have walked over 200 miles as part of the [NH Rebellion](http://www.nhrebellion.org/). I [ran as an independent in the 2014 Massachusetts U.S. Senate race](/walk), backed entirely by small dollar contributions and walking over 340 miles while collecting signatures to get on the ballot.

I also occasionally write for [Independent Voter Network](http://ivn.us/author/bruceskarin/) and most recently completed [reseach that includes a comprehensive model describing the relationship between campaign finance, institutional corruption, public policy, and income disparities]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link walk.md}). From this work I was able to compare and explore all the popular campaign finance reform proposals to see which are most effective and permanent.

Going forward I will continue doing all that I can manage to help restore citizen equality and our representative democracy so that the United States can once again live up to its full potential and provide a future for our children that is bright and full of opportunity.

title: Bruce Skarin - Scientist

<h1>Scientist</h1>
<p>The challenges before us are anything but simple. Some may prefer the simple soundbite policy used by politicians today, but the reality is that our Congress is not up to the task of truly understanding, let alone solving, the wide range of complex problems facing our nation. As a scientist I refuse to accept broken half measures as the best that Congress can do.</p>

<p>For the last decade I have worked on cutting edge research for our government covering a range of issues. In this role I have used analytics and simulation models to help people manage problems that cannot be fully understood without the aid of computers. During this time, I have seen both the potential of good people to do amazing work as well as the dysfunction created by an outdated, bureaucratic, system. Our country is capable of so much more.</p>

<p>With a federal revenue of over <a href="http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=REV" target="_blank">twice</a> that of the next county in the world, the United States has all the resources to be a world leader on just about every front. With my campaign I am promising to take the half of my budget that most candidates would spend on advertising and devote it to developing a fun and rewarding approach to solving problems together.</p>

<p>By using technology that simply did not exist just ten years ago, working with a community of professionals, and <a href="/issues">collecting feedback from supporters</a> like you, we will create a sustained effort for getting to the root of problems and solving them. It is time to upgrade the operating system of government and it begins with electing smart, bold, political outsiders to Washington.</p>
